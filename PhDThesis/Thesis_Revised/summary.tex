\chapter{Lay Summary}
This research focuses on geophysical imaging of Earth's crust based on the density and magnetic properties of rocks. This is done through an inversion process whereby gravity and magnetic field data collected above the surface are converted to a 3D model representing the sub-surface. Due to the nature of the inverse problem, there are infinite solutions that can satisfy the observed data. Conventional inversion algorithms yield smooth models that are difficult to interpret within a geological framework. I tackle these limitations with a flexible algorithm that allows me to generate a suite of possible candidates with variable characteristics. The algorithm is implemented for both scalar density and magnetization vector models. I then provide a learning strategy to extract dominant features from this suite of solutions using Principal Component Analysis. Finally, the efficacy of my approach is demonstrated using gravity and magnetic data acquired over the Kevitsa nickel deposit in Finland.
